# Java Number Guessing Game
This is a simple, yet interactive number guessing game built on Java. The goal is for the user to guess the number the computer is "thinking" of.

# How does it work?
1. The program will greet you and ask the user to enter an upper limit for the guessing game.
2. Once the limit is specified, the program will generate a random number between 1 and the limit specified prior.
3. The user will then be prompted to guess the randomized number until it's guessed correctly, or the user cancels the game.
4. The program will tell the user if your guess is higher/lower from the computer's generated number.
5. Once the number is guessed correctly, it will prompt a screen displaying that the user guessed correctly + the number of tries attempted.
6. Lastly, the user will be prompted if they'd like to play again.
